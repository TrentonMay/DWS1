            <h2><a name="about">About us</a></h2>
            <p>We're a <strong>Garry's Mod DarkRP</strong> community with all free jobs, no donor only perks,
                and really friendly admins! Come on in and play! You won't regret it. Everyone who plays on our servers
                enjoys every second they spend playing with like minded players that enjoy doing the same things you do!</p>

            <h3>What is there to do on <strong>Cyclone Rp?</strong></h3>
            <div id="columns">
                <article>
                    <p>Become the worlds best thief and steal printers, weapons and other items from players or become a
                    cop and stop other players from breaking the laws enacted by the mayor of the city. You may even become the
                    mayor if the other players of the server decide to vote you to be their new leader</p>
                    <p>Become a gun seller or even a dangerous gangster. But watch out! You may end up breaking the law and get
                    arrested and when you get arrested the police confiscate your guns and you have to start back from
                    the bottom. </p>
                    <p>On our servers there are all kinds of jobs for you to pursue but the one that everyone wants is to
                    be an Admin. Admins are the overseers of the server to make sure that no one crashes it and enforces certain
                    server-wide rules that are put in place to make sure everyone has a good time. Adminship can be gained
                    by proving to Cyclone Rp that you are a dedicated player and a small fee of $10 per month.</p>
